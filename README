libgio -- Programmable Virtual Files or Streams

Synopsis
	libgio is a small library to approximate Go's io.Reader and
	io.Writer interfaces, Common Lisp's grey-streams, and OpenVMS's
	programmable I/O. libgio takes a struct with the methods to read
	or write to the stream, open and close the stream, and some other
	stuff, and returns a libgio file descriptor. You can then use this
	descriptor to read, write, seek, open, and close the stream. Note
	that these are not normal file descriptors, but they look like it,
	and basically feel like it.

struct ReadWriter {
	RWLock;
	int (*open)(ReadWriter*);
	int (*close)(ReadWriter*);
	long (*pread)(ReadWriter*, void*, long, vlong);
	long (*pwrite)(ReadWriter*, void*, long, vlong);
	void *aux;
	u64int offset;
	u64int length;
};

int gopen(ReadWriter*, void *aux)
	This function takes a ReadWriter struct and auxillary data, and
	creates a gio file descriptor.

int gclose(int gio_fd)
	This destroys the gio file descriptor.

long gread(int gio_fd, void *buf, long len, vlong off)
	This is functionally the same as pread, but operates on a gio fd.

long gwrite(int gio_fd, void *buf, long len, vlong off)
	This is functionally the same as pwrite, but operates on a gio fd.

vlong gseek(int gio_fd, vlong off, int whence)
	This is functionally the same as seek but operates on a gio fd.

int fd2gio(int fd)
	This takes a system fd and returns a gio fd.
